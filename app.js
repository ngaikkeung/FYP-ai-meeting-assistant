         "content": "* * *  5 (I) The Scope of Work 4.1 FEHD’s work could be divided into two main areas: food safety and environmental hygiene. To ensure that food sold in Hong Kong was safe and suitable for consumption, the Centre for Food Safety conducted regular inspection and sample testing at import, wholesale and retail levels, enacted relevant legislation and enhanced promotion and public education. Regarding the work on environmental hygiene, FEHD was responsible for food business licensing, hawker management, public market management, street cleansing, refuse collection, public toilet services, pest control, water seepage in buildings, dripping of air-conditioners, the management of cemeteries, crematoria and columbaria and regulation of the funeral business. FEHD employed about 11,000 staff at present (not including outsourced workers) and the expenditure for this financial year amounted to around HK$7.6 billion. (II) Cleanliness of the District 4.2 FEHD had all along adopted a multi-pronged approach including increasing resources, enhancing public education and taking enforcement actions to ensure the cleanliness of the district. Increase in Resources - New contracts were signed with street cleansing contractors and the number of outsourced cleansing workers in Kowloon City District had risen to 433 from 370, representing an increase of 17%. FEHD would continue to bid for more resources to improve the hygiene of the district. - Recently, FEHD had used pressure washer surface cleaners to clean the streets at some pilot areas in Kowloon City District and the results were remarkable. FEHD would gradually introduce the use of pressure washer surface cleaners to the 18 districts in Hong Kong. Public Education - She thanked Members and district leaders for their participation in the publicity work on maintaining hygiene and fostering civic-mindedness among members of the public. She hoped to continue to join hands with them to step up publicity so as to upkeep environmental hygiene in the district. 6 - A Facebook page and an Instagram account had been opened for the Keep Clean Ambassador Ah Tak. His TV and radio Announcements of Public Interest would be broadcast to enhance public awareness of keeping the environment clean. Taking Enforcement Actions - FEHD had, in June and October 2018, installed Internet Protocol (IP) cameras at six refuse deposit black spots in Kowloon City District with an aim to combat illegal waste disposal. - FEHD had set up dedicated enforcement teams to step up prosecution efforts against persons who contravened cleansing legislation at various hygiene black spots. (III) Prevention and Control of Mosquito and Rodent Problems 4.3.1 At the beginning of this year, the manpower of the Pest Control Teams in Kowloon City District was increased. FEHD was also considering the introduction of new technology such as night-vision video capturing technology and artificial intelligence to monitor and detect rodent activities in rear lanes and markets so as to plan for the anti-rodent work more accurately. In addition, FEHD was testing a new kind of rodent trap in To Kwa Wan Market. The scent of the new traps would draw rodents and then the pneumatic system would kill them instantly. If the results of the trial were satisfactory, the new rodent traps would be introduced to the 18 districts in Hong Kong. 4.3.2 FEHD would enhance the collaboration among departments such as the Housing Department (HD) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) in order to monitor and tackle the rodent problem. The Pest Control Steering Committee coordinated by the Food and Health Bureau (FHB) would hold meetings every year to map out the focus of work and follow up on the effectiveness of the rodent control work. 4.3.3 In the light of current rodent infestation in public housing estates and LCSD’s parks, FEHD would strengthen liaison with the relevant departments and offer them technical support. FEHD and HD had conducted a series of joint operations in Oi Man Estate in July 2018 and rodent infestation was found to be improved. FEHD would make ongoing efforts to control rodents with HD 7 and carry out rodent disinfestation work in various housing estates for other estates’ reference. 4.3.4 Regarding mosquito infestation, in view that transmission of Dengue Fever in the territory mainly took place at construction sites, FEHD set up law enforcement and inspection teams in mid-2017 to enhance inspection of construction sites and take enforcement actions. In addition, in the light of rodent infestation, FEHD would step up its efforts in advising restaurants and food premises the correct ways of disposing of food waste and refuse and prosecuting offenders. (IV) Shop Front Extensions (SFEs) 4.4 The problem of SFEs at black spots in Kowloon City District was under control after the Fixed Penalty Tickets Scheme became effective in September 2016. However, more street obstruction cases not related to illegal hawking such as placing goods at roadsides, on pavements and roads increased recently. Thus, FEHD would institute prosecutions against SFEs which caused environmental hygiene problems. If the obstruction problem posed hazards to road users or led to other problems, the relevant government departments would coordinate interdepartmental joint operations. (v) Columbaria and Funeral Services 4.5.1 FEHD would identify suitable locations for constructing public columbaria in different districts using a district-based approach in order to increase the number of public niches. Columbaria at Wong Nai Chung Road in Wan Chai, Tsang Tsui in Tuen Mun and Wo Hop Shek in North District would be progressively completed, providing some 200,000 public niches. Considering the possible impacts on traffic to nearby areas, FEHD would firstly allocate about 21,000 niches to the public at the beginning of 2019. Moreover, the Department would continue to follow up on the proposed new columbaria awaiting funding approval for implementation of construction. 4.5.2 To ensure the sustainable development of columbaria, FEHD implemented an extendable arrangement for niches. New niches would be allocated initially for an interment period of 20 years, followed by extension every ten years. The niches would be re-allocated if no renewal application was received and 8 the cremated human ashes would be handled in a dignified manner. 4.5.3 The Private Columbaria Ordinance came into effect in mid-2017. FEHD then started receiving applications since March 2018 and the Private Columbaria Licensing Board would speed up the processing of the applications. It was hoped that private columbaria could be licensed as soon as possible and the supply of niches could be resumed. 4.5.4 Around 50,000 people passed away each year and over 90 percent of the bodies of the deceased were cremated. Due to the shortage of land in Hong Kong, FEHD hoped to promote green burials like scattering ashes at gardens of remembrance or at sea. According to statistics, 14 out of every 100 deceased persons followed the green burial path last year. The Department planned to build gardens of remembrance in newly completed columbaria and organise large-scale promotional activities to encourage people to express their wishes for green burials to family members so that their wishes would be fulfilled after they died. 5. Mr Roger KWAN thanked the Superintendent and the frontline staff of FEHD for giving active response to rodent infestation and various environmental hygiene problems, conducting site inspections in private buildings and offering opinions on pest control. He raised the following views: (i) he hoped FEHD could strengthen publicity and raise public awareness of keeping the environment clean in To Kwa Wan; (ii) although the short-term anti-rodent operations conducted in designated target areas were effective, the Department should launch long-term operations targeting rodent infestation black spots and use new anti-rodent devices as soon as possible; (iii) the current legislation against SFEs did not restrict the placement of goods at roadsides, on pavements and roads. He suggested both FEHD and HKPF to take enforcement actions in order to achieve a deterrent effect; and (iv) many scavengers placed styrofoam and cardboards at public places, on private streets or in rear lanes, causing obstruction and hygiene problems. He suggested FEHD and HKPF to enhance coordination and disperse scavengers but he opposed to strong action against them. 6. The Hon Starry LEE put forward the following opinions: (i) she hoped the Director of FEHD could seriously address the environmental hygiene problems in Kowloon City District and the Superintendent could regularly report the environmental hygiene conditions in the district to Members; (ii) as street cleansing contractors did 9 not recruit sufficient workers, there was a lack of manpower in cleansing the streets. Thus, FEHD should improve the tendering approach for appointing cleansing contractors, that is, awarding contracts to the lowest bidders. The Department should consider introducing a rating system of cleansing services by district councils and requesting contractors to use advanced equipment to improve the overall cleanliness of Hong Kong; (iii) thanks to Members’ efforts, FEHD had decided to install cameras at hygiene black spots in Kowloon City District. Subject to district circumstances and with public consent, the Department should expedite the installation of cameras at suitable spots to improve environmental hygiene; and (iv) management problems arose in many streets in the district. Apart from conducting interdepartmental joint actions to tackle, say, improper placement of cardboards by scavengers, the Department should try adopting other thorough approaches to address the problems. 7. Mr Admond YUE raised the following views / enquiries: (i) the cleansing contracts were awarded to the lowest bidders, who hired many elders as cleansing workers. And it was unsatisfactory for the elders to be responsible for cleansing work. Thus, FEHD should review the existing tendering system; and (ii) most of the private housing estates had applied rodenticides with better efficacy. The Department should consider introducing and applying new rodenticides at the soonest to eliminate rodents so as to curb the spread of rodents in Hong Kong. 8. Mr YANG Wing-kit expressed the following opinions: (i) since rodent infestation was deteriorating, some residents had to move to other places temporarily so that their houses could be fully cleaned and rodents be eliminated. Rodent infestation had caused serious nuisances to residents. Thus, he requested FEHD to maintain communication with the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) to discuss the rodent infestation problem in the housing estates of HKHS; (ii) he requested FEHD to exploit new technology to conduct anti-rodent work and share the experience with public and private housing estates with a view to uprooting the rodent problem; and (iii) though the Department claimed that the frequency of street cleansing was increased to eight times a day, the hygiene conditions were still very poor. He requested FEHD to review the current regime and introduce innovative equipment for street cleansing such as making reference to Sham Shui Po District where street cleansing was performed by street washing vehicles and effective monitoring on contractors was conducted. In addition, the Department should allow district councils to give ratings on the performance of cleansing contractors in order to respond to public views on the cleanliness of different districts and improve the overall street environment and the rodent infestation problem. 10  9. Mr Ronald YEUNG thanked the Department and the Kowloon City District Environmental Hygiene Office for their efforts and put forward the following views: (i) as anti-rodent operations in designated target areas achieved positive results, he hoped FEHD could continue to strengthen the relevant work; (ii) the frontline staff of FEHD had received a large number of complaints about the cleanliness of the district and they were confused about the need to take strict enforcement in respect of each complaint. He suggested the Department to maintain good communication with Members or community leaders so that priorities could be accurately accorded to different issues; (iii) some individuals who made a living by recycling the waste knew well the work patterns of FEHD and thus they could easily evade the enforcement actions taken by the Department. However, the recent joint operations conducted by HKPF, FEHD and the Kowloon City District Office had successfully removed numerous articles causing street obstruction. Therefore, he suggested increasing the number of joint operations; and (iv) hygiene problems were expected to be worsened after the implementation of the municipal solid waste charging. FEHD and the relevant departments must actively step up education and tackle the enforcement issue to prevent ecological disasters. 10. Mr LUK King-kwong raised the following views: (i) though many Members stated that FEHD had spared no efforts in following up the rodent problem, rodent infestation kept worsening in the district. He opined that the Department should reflect on the effectiveness of measures implemented in the past and he queried that the Department had failed to introduce and deploy new equipment for rodent control at an earlier time; (ii) the water seepage problem in the buildings in Kowloon City District was serious, but the Joint Office (JO) was not willing to follow up water seepage cases on the ground that the moisture content measured did not reach 35%. This caused great annoyance to residents; and (iii) FEHD should maintain communication with HD, HKHS and private property management companies and share methods or new technology for rodent elimination in order to resolve rodent problems as soon as possible. 11. Dr the Hon Priscilla LEUNG expressed the following opinions: (i) the severity of rodent infestation had exceeded normal standards. Housing estates in Kowloon City District including Whampoa East, Laguna Verde, Oi Man Estate and Lok Man Sun Chuen were all infested by rodents. The Department should study the cause of the problem and find out if it was related to the construction works; (ii) the weather of Guangzhou was similar to that of Hong Kong and rodent and mosquito problems there were effectively controlled after ten years’ efforts. The experience was a 11 valuable source of reference for the Department to study and follow; and (iii) the Department should review the outsourced cleansing contracts and provide monetary incentives to contractors with good performance. 12. Mr LAM Tak-shing put forward the following views: (i) he requested to clarify the roles and responsibilities of FEHD and the Buildings Department in JO. The moisture content not reaching the prescribed level should not be used as the sole reason for not following up water seepage cases. The skills and equipment for handling water seepage problems should be enhanced and upgraded so as to deal with water seepage in buildings; (ii) the licensing applications for columbaria had begun for 11 months but some columbaria in the district were still unlicensed. FEHD should expedite the vetting of the applications and strengthen enforcement actions; (iii) FEHD and the Environmental Protection Department should allow incense burners to be open all year round for columbaria visitors to burn paper offerings and incense; (iv) FEHD and HKPF should step up regulation and enforcement in order to improve street obstruction caused by flower shops; (v) barbeque and skewer stalls in the district had seriously blocked the streets at nighttime, causing obstruction to residents. He requested the Department to address and follow up the issue; (vi) FEHD should provide effective solutions in tackling the problem of street sleepers in Station Lane; and (vii) FEHD should timely enhance the environmental hygiene of its markets and optimise the equipment for various purposes. They should also adopt corresponding measures to ensure the hygiene and safety of siu mei and lo mei shops in markets on handling meat and cooked food so as to prevent food poisoning cases. 13. Ir Dr CHENG Lee-ming raised the following opinions: (i) given the high reproductive rate of rodents, the rodent problem had extended from the area of Princess Margaret Road to private buildings in the district. Thus, FEHD should address the issue immediately in order to prevent any outbreak of dangerous epidemics; (ii) since photos taken by cameras installed at hygiene black spots could not be used to prosecute persons who had illegally deposited articles owing to the legal problem, FEHD had to arrange additional staff to institute prosecutions on the spot. Thus, the results were unsatisfactory; (iii) when handling the water seepage problem in buildings, the powers and responsibilities of each department was ambiguous and thus the problem could not be properly dealt with. FEHD should hence review JO’s work and define clearly the legal standards for prosecuting people causing seepage problems; (iv) he requested FEHD to revise the law and require tourists who littered cigarette butts to pay the fines before leaving Hong Kong or deny their re-entry into Hong Kong; and (v) the hygiene conditions of Waterloo Road and the footbridge at Hak Po Street were poor and some 12 individuals had even occupied the footbridge and deposited refuse. He requested FEHD to look closely to the situation and take appropriate follow-up actions without delay. 14. Mr Tony NG stated that the biggest problem faced by the community was rodent infestation. HD had handed over the anti-rodent work to cleansing companies. Apart from distributing glue traps to residents, both HD and the cleansing companies claimed that it was the household’s responsibility to deal with rodents in the house and thus they refused to assist residents in eliminating rodents. He opined that in order to resolve the problem at root, HD must intervene proactively and assist residents in capturing rodents and take interdepartmental joint actions. In addition, he hoped that FEHD could take reference from the anti-rodent work conducted by other countries and introduce new equipment for rodent disinfestation as soon as possible. 15. Mr Terence SIU put forward the following views: (i) Hong Kong was a small place with a dense population and serious hygiene problems arose at hygiene black spots like rear lanes. These undoubtedly further reduced urban spaces; (ii) though people always reported to FEHD the pigeon-feeding black spots and prosecutions were instituted, pigeon-feeding activities still prevailed and the problem could not be completely solved; (iii) air-conditioners of individual old buildings were always dripping and pedestrians and people waiting for buses were affected. The problem had never got settled; (iv) water seepage problem in buildings could not be solved because the moisture content detected was not high enough; (v) the current $1,500 penalty for littering should be increased. The Department should also make reference to Singapore and introduce a progressive penalty system and even request offenders to provide social services; (vi) the pneumatic gun for rodent elimination was only wide enough for killing small-sized or medium-sized rats but not the sizeable ones in Hong Kong. FEHD should educate food premises on the ways of rodent elimination; (vii) FEHD should report Hong Kong’s Hepatitis E cases transmitted from rats to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Central Government and invite experts to work out together the rodent elimination approaches suitable for Hong Kong; and (viii) FEHD could use artificial intelligence for image recognition in order to help confirm the locations of environmental hygiene black spots and institute prosecutions. 16. Mr NG Po-keung raised the following opinions: (i) the conditions of a number of hygiene black spots would return to the original state shortly after inspectors of FEHD had carried out inspections. Thus, he requested the Department to install cameras and enhance prosecutions; (ii) shop owners in Kowloon City Market voiced 13 out the viability problem of the market and the insufficiency of parking spaces to the Department. They hoped that FEHD could increase the number of festivities and promotional activities and consider redeveloping Kowloon City Market to provide an underground car park; and (iii) residents reflected that the hygiene conditions of rear lanes or streets were unsatisfactory, but the number of cleansing conducted at hygiene black spots by cleansing contractors was obscure. Thus, he requested the Department to place attendance books for outsourced cleansing workers at hygiene black spots in an effort to monitor their performance. 17. Mr LAI Kwong-wai expressed the following enquiries / opinions: (i) currently, FEHD could not remove miscellaneous items and take enforcement actions at private streets owing to the legal problem. Thus, he requested the Government to revise the law and empower the Department to conduct cleansing work at private streets; (ii) the effectiveness of pneumatic rodent traps was recently questioned. It was pointed out that they were not suitable for use in Hong Kong. Thus, he enquired whether the Department would review the effectiveness of the traps and introduce other high-tech products for tackling rodent infestation problem; (iii) JO had, in 2013, started to pilot the use of infrared radiation, microwave tomography and other technology to handle water seepage in buildings. However, he was puzzled about JO’s postponement of the pilot scheme to June 2018 and he queried that the study period was too long. In addition, JO should reduce the use of traditional colour water and make use of high technology in identifying the source of water seepage at the first stage of investigation; and (iv) Mainland tourists improperly disposed of cigarette butts and refuse in Hung Hom and To Kwa Wan and caused hygiene problems. Thus, the Department should deploy additional staff to combat the problems. 18. Mr SIU Leong-sing put forward the following views: (i) he requested JO to introduce new technology to improve the effectiveness of work and increase manpower to handle the water seepage problem; (ii) he requested the Department to enhance education on rodent prevention and control. Apart from distributing publicity leaflets and educating the public by the Keep Clean Ambassador Ah Tak, the Department could organise talks on rodent control in the district and invite incorporated owners (IOs) and interested residents to join so that the situation could be improved at the source; (iii) with the implementation of the municipal solid waste charging, the problem of refuse deposit was bound to become more severe. Thus, the Department must step up prosecutions against offenders; and (iv) many Mainland tourists improperly disposed of cigarette butts and refuse in the district. FEHD should not only enhance prosecution but also consider amending the law to deny offenders’ re-entry into Hong 14 Kong. 19. Miss KWONG Po-yin expressed the following views: (i) currently, the cleansing staff of FEHD carried out frequent street washing in response to fouling of places like footbridges by dog faeces, but the number of prosecutions remained low. The problem was not yet solved; (ii) in order to monitor the performance of contractors, the Department should introduce a penalty against contractors who failed to comply with the conditions in the contracts besides allowing KCDC to give ratings on the daily work of contractors; (iii) the Department should specify in the contracts that, when employing cleansing staff, contractors should conduct physical assessments and knowledge tests on waste separation. The relevant staff must meet a certain standard in order to raise the service quality; (iv) the time for processing water seepage cases was too long at present. Thus, she requested JO and the relevant departments to follow up the problem as soon as possible; and (v) presently, the rodent infestation was severe everywhere in the district. Apart from enhancing anti-rodent work, the Government should urge private housing estates to conduct rodent prevention and control work such as holding talks on anti-rodent measures and penalise people who defied regulations so as to combat the rodent problem thoroughly. 20. Mr LO Chiu-kit gave the following views: (i) the problems of mosquito and rodent infestation were closely related to a high density of population and were more common in areas outside the purview of FEHD, such as public markets, public housing estates and parks. In view of the occurrence of human infection by rat hepatitis E virus in Hong Kong, he believed the Government should enhance resources to step up anti-rodent work in small districts and suggested that FEHD join forces with other relevant departments to perform rodent control; (ii) although three-nil buildings were not under the management of FEHD, ignoring the hygienic conditions in these buildings would fail to root out the rodent problem; (iii) FEHD should collaborate with HD and HKHS in conducting anti-mosquito and anti-rodent operations in public housing estates; (iv) even though the problem of street obstruction by shop extension was eased following the enactment of Fixed Penalty Ordinance, it was still serious in Dyer Avenue, where spaces were occupied for packing of goods and placement of styrofoam boxes at weekends; (v) Members were pleased with the effects of the installation of surveillance cameras at hygienic black spots. However, FEHD stated that it had to wait until a review of the scheme was conducted and a further application for funds was made before more surveillance cameras could be installed. He hoped FEHD could exercise discretion and allocate additional resources soon; (vi) cleanliness in Hong Kong was deteriorating. Therefore, different aspects of the outsourcing system should be subject 15 to reviews, including the arrangement of outsourcing all cleaning work, the possibility of letting FEHD staff to undertake some of the work and the effectiveness of work of FEHD as compared with that of outsourced contractors; (vii) he requested JO to proactively initiate prosecution against people causing water seepage; and (viii) FEHD should improve the operating environment of public markets and freeze the rental for public market stalls in the next few years. 21. Ir CHEUNG Yan-hong expressed the following opinions: (i) he demanded to follow up the problem of street obstruction resulting from shop extension in 2008 but it was not alleviated until September 2016 after the Fixed Penalty Ordinance had come into effect. This showed the importance of imposing a fine; (ii) the age of outsourced cleaners working at the hygienic black spots of rubbish and dog fouling in his sub-district was generally high. He enquired if FEHD could set the maximum age of workers in outsourcing contracts in order to strengthen the effectiveness of cleaning; (iii) rodent infestation and an increase in rubbish were connected with restaurants. He requested FEHD to urge frontline staff to enhance regular inspections and law enforcement actions in the district as well as carry out cleaning work using innovative equipment such as water cannons and manually controlled street sweeping machines; and (iv) despite differences in legislation, civic awareness and ways of cleaning between Hong Kong and Singapore, Hong Kong could still make reference to the ways of combating rodent and mosquito problems in Singapore and consider launching different pilot schemes. 22. Mr HO Hin-ming aired his views: (i) FEHD should tighten the monitoring of cleaning work of outsourced contractors. For instance, it could request the contractors to video record the process of cleaning; (ii) FEHD should study ways to dispose of the rubbish left inside tree stumps and tree roots on roads after natural disasters; (iii) FEHD should compile statistics and conduct analysis of the number of rats, the breeding rate of rats as well as the speed of killing rats in Hong Kong to formulate long-term solutions like using contraceptive pills to reduce the breeding rate of rats as implemented in Singapore; (iv) quite a number of recycling bins were damaged. As a result, items deposited in the bins for recycling became rubbish. He believed the relevant department should address the problem properly; (v) some buildings discarded large black bags of rubblish on roads. As they failed to coordinate with refuse collection vehicles in advance, the bags of rubbish accumulated on roads for a long period of time and affected the environmental hygiene; (vi) JO should follow up every case involving water seepage in buildings. It should verify whether water seepage occurred and notify the relevant building owners so that the owners could 16 resolve the problem on their own; and (vii) though contents recorded on surveillance cameras might not be used for prosecution, FEHD could make reference to the laser speed guns installed by the police, some of which were not in operation, and install the outer casings of surveillance cameras at different locations to create a deterrent effect. 23. Mr Jimmy LAM expressed the following views: (i) although issuing fixed penalty tickets against street obstruction did not produce any actual deterrent effect on individual shops and recycling stores, he hoped the frontline staff of FEHD could enhance law enforcement and immediately take enforcement action against shops which breached regulations; (ii) JO insisted that follow-up actions would be carried out only when the moisture content of seepage areas reached 35%. Nevertheless, in some of the cases, the source of seepage could not be identified even after carrying out traditional colour water tests for several times. Thus he suggested that JO use the latest technology in investigations; (iii) Sung On Street in the district was a hygienic black spot. As FEHD did not install surveillance cameras there, some people just dumped rubbish on the street. He opined that FEHD should install surveillance cameras at all hygienic black spots soon; (iv) the hygienic condition in To Kwa Wan District had all along been unsatisfactory. The large number of construction sites in the district further worsened the rodent problem. He hoped FEHD would adopt new technology, such as pneumatic installations, in anti-rodent operations before the new year; (v) bills were stuck all over railings, lampposts and distribution boxes in the district. The staff of FEHD only cleared away the bills, but failed to tackle the problem at the source by bringing prosecution against the relevant people, and thus the problem remained unsolved; and (vi) he requested FEHD to report the frequency of street cleaning performed in each district to Members before the next meeting of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Committee. 24. Miss Vivian LAU, JP, Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene expressed wholehearted gratitude to Members for their valuable comments. She stated that the goal of FEHD was consistent with Members’, that is, to keep districts tidy and clean so that people could live a pleasant life. She made a response to Members’ enquiries and views, with main points as follows: (i) Cleaning 24.1.1 Over 80% of street cleaning work in Kowloon City District was undertaken by outsourced contractors employed by FEHD. The lowest bidder rule would not be the sole factor to be considered in the tender evaluation process 17 and about 40% of contracts were not awarded to the lowest bidder. Under the present marking scheme for evaluating tenders, the tender price carried a weighting of 70% while the technical capability was of 30%. The Labour and Welfare Bureau had been preparing for the introduction of a new marking scheme which would be adopted from 1 April 2019. Under the new marking scheme, the technical capability of a tenderer would carry a weighting of not less than 50% while the tender price would account for the other 50%. To enhance protection to non-skilled workers, the weighting of wage should be at least 25% of the technical score. It was hoped that the new marking scheme would prompt contractors to provide better service and employ more suitable workers. 24.1.2 At present, outsourced cleaning contracts required contractors to provide street cleaning service at the standard required. For example, rubbish bins on busy streets must be cleared when they were 70% full. However, the contracts did not set a maximum age for cleaning workers. 24.1.3 FEHD could report to KCDC the frequency of street cleaning. Regarding the time of cleaning, as FEHD would conduct flexible deployment in the district when necessary and outsourced contractors would follow instructions to modify the places and time of cleaning and thus, the relevant information about the time of cleaning might not reflect the real situation. 24.1.4 FEHD held the responsibility of deploying resources to handle hygienic problems at public streets first according to the priority in resource allocation. Nevertheless, FEHD would strive for resources to assist in the cleaning of private streets when necessary and when resources permitted. (ii) Internet Protocol (IP) cameras 24.2.1 After testing the effects of the installation of IP cameras at rubbish black spots, FEHD had so far installed IP cameras at 80 rubbish black spots in Hong Kong, six of which were located in Kowloon City District. 24.2.2 The videos shot by IP cameras had limited uses. If IP cameras could capture the plate numbers of vehicles dumping waste illegally, FEHD could directly initiate prosecution against the vehicle owners. However, people often dumped construction waste using hand carts, so videos taken by IP 18 cameras were generally not accepted as evidences by court due to problems of proof. To follow up these cases, FEHD would make reference to the video recordings and designate staff to carry out on-site monitoring and prosecution work at the time when the number of people dumping waste illegally was the highest so as to enhance the effectiveness of enforcement action. 24.2.3 To increase the number of IP cameras and allow FEHD a higher degree of flexibility, she agreed with Members’ suggestion that there was no need to keep all IP cameras in operation and disclose the details of operation to the public. The suggestion could be followed up and discussed again by the committees of KCDC. (iii) Rodent prevention and control 24.3.1 The most effective ways of combating rodent infestation were to handle rubbish properly and maintain places clean. The existing ways of monitoring as well as preventing and controlling rodent infestation were developed on the basis of the suggestions of WHO made in the former discussion. To help handle the rodent problem more effectively, experts from WHO would be deputed to visit Hong Kong in early 2019 to suggest the latest ways of preventing and controlling the rodent problem. 24.3.2 FEHD had bought anti-rodent pressure guns and carried out trials at venues like To Kwa Wan Market. However, no effects could be seen in the first two weeks of trial and so it was believed that the scent produced by the pressure guns failed to draw rats in Hong Kong. That was why FEHD speedily replaced the pressure guns with a different type and conducted trials of the new guns. If the new pressure guns were proved to be effective, they would be introduced to all the 18 districts soon.  24.3.3 Restaurants and back alleys were the main breeding grounds for rodents. FEHD would launch anti-rodent operations targeting restaurants in December, including explaining to restaurants ways to block the entry of rats to the restaurants from back alleys as well as ways to handle food waste and rubbish properly, the compulsory requirement of using lidded rubbish bins for temporary storage and the prohibition of preparing food and washing dishes at back alleys, etc. If any irregularities were found, FEHD 19 would initiate prosecution and issue demerit points under its demerit point system. The licence of any restaurant which had accrued certain demerit points would be temporarily suspended or even cancelled in case of repeated breaches. 24.3.4 FEHD would conduct a territory-wide year-end clean-up campaign before the lunar new year holiday. It would employ more resources and hire more cleaners in a bid to improve the cleanliness of the community. 24.3.5 At the central level, a steering committee was coordinated by FHB to organise the work on the prevention and control of pests and rodents. Besides, FHB had issued letters to departmental directors earlier to call upon various departments to collaborate with FEHD in combating rodent infestation. FEHD also hoped to gain support from Members to carry out promotional campaigns at the district level and to teach people ways to tackle the rodent problem. (iv) Water seepage 24.4.1 Owners of private buildings held accountability of managing and maintaining the buildings they inhabited properly, including resolving the problem of water seepage between floors. Nevertheless, when the problem caused a hygienic nuisance, a risk to structural safety of buildings and wastage of drinking water, the Government would intervene at an appropriate time and refer the cases to relevant departments for follow-ups. As the buildings were private property, JO would not dig through walls or ceilings to locate the source of water seepage and would just conduct investigations by non-destructive means. 24.4.2 JO followed the suggestions of consultants and conducted the pilot use of microwave and infrared in investigations into water seepage cases in three districts including Central, Wan Chai and Kowloon City. And from June 2018 up to now, more than half of the 70 pilot cases were conducted in Kowloon City District. 24.4.3 JO conducted tests by means of water colour tests, the results of which could be used as grounds for prosecution and accepted as evidences by the court. On the other hand, results of tests conducted using infrared and microwave 20 were considered as indirect evidences and were not accepted as evidential proof by the court. Besides, infrared and microwave were not applicable when water was sourced from the pipes in the floor ceilings or covered with porcelain tiles. 24.4.4 The use of infrared and microwave in a single case cost about $9,000. To ensure the prudent use of public fund, FEHD would consider whether to adopt this technology in a large scale in the future. (v) Others 24.5.1 The problem of street obstruction by shops should be handled through collaboration among different government departments. It was hoped that coordination with the relevant departments at the district management level could be more effective so as to combat the problem. Matters related to environmental hygiene fell within the purview of FEHD and FEHD would make efforts to resolve the problems. It would also try hard to cooperate with other relevant departments to deal with the problem of street obstruction by shops. As regards the problem of water dripping from air conditioners, the existing law provided that the housing units causing the nuisance be notified first and a Nuisance Order be issued requiring the removal of the nuisance within a specified period. It was only when the requirements of the Nuisance Order were not complied with after the specified time period that the relevant department could bring prosecution against the people concerned and apply to the court for issuing an order for a complete abatement of nuisance when a ruling was made. Therefore, the whole process was rather time consuming. In fact, the members of the public held the responsibility of arranging inspections and maintaining their air-conditioners to ensure that they did not cause any nuisance when in use. In the long run, she suggested studying whether it was necessary to revise the relevant legislation and introduce other penalties. 24.5.2 FEHD would examine whether the use of spaces in the existing markets was optimised and conduct a trial of the Market Modernisation Programme at Aberdeen Market. If the trial yielded positive results, the extension of the programme to other markets would be considered. 24.5.3 Various government departments had all along assisted in clearing tree 21 stumps and tree roots after natural disasters. As typhoons in recent years had caused great destruction, FEHD gave priority to the removal of collapsed trees near residential areas lest mosquito would breed and people would dispose of rubbish there unlawfully. The existing tree stumps and tree roots on pathways were not under the care of FEHD and the relevant government departments were contacted for follow-ups. 25. The Chairman made a conclusion of the discussion. He thanked Miss Vivian LAU for informing Members about the work of FEHD and responding to their enquiries and views about the work of JO, outsourced cleaning service, niches, street management, market management, water dripping of air conditioners and feeding of pigeons, etc. Confirmation of Minutes of the 17th Meeting of KCDC 26. There being no amendments proposed, the Chairman announced that the minutes of the 17th meeting were confirmed unanimously. Resumption of Private Land on Chun Tin Street / Sung Chi Street in To Kwa Wan in Kowloon for the Implementation of Development Scheme KC-008(A) by the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) Resumption of Private Land on Bailey Street / Wing Kwong Street in To Kwa Wan in Kowloon for the Implementation of Development Project KC-009 by URA Resumption of Private Land on Hung Fook Street / Ngan Hon Street in To Kwa Wan in Kowloon for the Implementation of Development Scheme KC-010 by URA Resumption of Private Land on Hung Fook Street / Kai Ming Street in To Kwa Wan in Kowloon for the Implementation of Development Project KC-011 by URA Resumption of Private Land on Wing Kwong Street in To Kwa Wan in Kowloon for the Implementation of Development Project KC-012 by URA Resumption of Private Land on Kai Ming Street / Wing Kwong Street in To Kwa Wan in Kowloon for the Implementation of Development Project KC-013 by URA (KCDC Paper No. 93/18) 27. Ms Maggie AU, Senior Estate Surveyor of the Lands Department (LandsD), Mr Mike KWAN, General Manager (Planning and Design) of URA and Mr Ian WONG, Director (Acquisition and Clearance) of URA introduced Paper No. 93/18. They hoped to consult Members on the six development projects / schemes in To Kwa Wan District. They would also report Members’ suggestions about land 22 resumption to the Secretary for Development and the Chief Executive in Council. 28. Mr HO Hin-ming stated that at present, if URA could acquire over 80% of the property titles, it could apply for compulsory sale to resume the remaining property titles. He enquired in what ways URA dealt with the property owners who rejected its acquisition offers. 29. The Hon Starry LEE expressed views as follows: (i) the acquisition of old buildings in Kowloon City District by URA for redevelopment had a rather late start. She hoped the pace of redevelopment in the district could be expedited and URA would consider including other old districts, such as the Thirteen Street, in the redevelopment schemes; (ii) URA’s redevelopment projects in old district were generally welcomed by the public, but there were still some affected residents who thought that the redevelopment schemes impacted on their original lives. She asked URA what support was provided to owners of ground floor shops or tenants who had turned down the acquisition proposals, say, whether URA would provide assistance to them in seeking rehousing flats or shop premises in other districts; and (iii) she learnt that URA adopted a district-based approach in launching the various aforementioned projects. She enquired about the timetable of the entire redevelopment scheme. 30. Mr Jimmy LAM raised the following views: (i) he gave positive feedback to the acquisition schemes carried out by URA in the district; (ii) URA should speedily handle the problems of rehousing and compensating tenants, follow up the issue that allocated public housing flats were rather small in size as well as revise the compensation ordinance, including formulating the compensation rate for rented and vacant flats; (iii) some flats in redevelopment areas had been locked up after they were acquired. This caused concern over security and cleaning of the area among residents who had not yet moved out. He hoped URA would conduct follow-ups; and (iv) residents had started moving into Upper East. The new property owners were worried that the quietness of the environment in the district would be ruined by reconstruction works nearby. Thus he requested URA to account for the future planning in the district. 31. Miss KWONG Po-yin put forward the following views / enquiries: (i) the procedures of URA of allocating public housing flats to affected tenants were different from the general arrangements of allocating public housing to the public. Different households of the same family size were allotted different sizes of flats, which was unfair; (ii) some property owners would substantially increase rent on tenants. As a result, the tenants could not afford the rent and had to move out. This was not 23 considered as eviction and the owners could receive a larger sum of compensation. She was of the view that URA or LandsD should strengthen measures to plug the loophole; (iii) URA should arrange to meet with occupants of rooftop structures who were previously affected by typhoon; and (iv) URA should continue to proactively negotiate with property owners who had rejected the acquisition offers earlier. 32. Mr Ronald YEUNG gave the following views: (i) he requested URA to acquire old buildings around the Fifth Street and the Thirteen Street soon for redevelopment; (ii) he was concerned about the rehousing of tenants. He enquired if URA had enhanced its measures to provide support, including relocation fee, to people who were not allocated public housing; and (iii) he requested URA to improve its compensation mechanism to help shops affected by redevelopment find suitable premises in the district to continue operation. 33. Mr Ian WONG of URA made a consolidated reply, with main points as follows: 33.1 To facilitate communication with the affected owners and tenants of the various aforementioned redevelopment projects in To Kwa Wan District, URA had established a neighbourhood centre at Sunshine Plaza in Bailey Street in the district. 33.2 URA would do its best to acquire all property units which could not yet been resumed. If eventually there were property owners who rejected the acquisition offers of URA, the Government would need to invoke the Lands Resumption Ordinance (LRO) to resume the remaining units. In the course of land resumption, the Government would calculate the amount of compensation paid to the relevant property owners based on the market value of the land on the day of reversion. 33.3 URA had as many as 15 redevelopment projects in Kowloon City District. It would continue to review the situation in the district and adopt a sustainable urban renewal model to plan on the directions of redevelopment and rehabilitation in the district. Nevertheless, due to the principle of confidentiality, URA could only make public the relevant information about redevelopment when finalised. Besides, URA provided intermediary service to assist small property owners in assembling property titles for joint sale in the market. 24  33.4 Large scale redevelopment involved relocation of residents and shops. At present, more than 200 tenants had moved out and URA had provided rehousing units, through the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) and HKHS, to eligible domestic tenants. These tenants were rehoused in public rental housing and subsidised flats in So Uk Estate, On Tai Estate, Chun Seen Mei Chuen, Lok Man Sun Chuen, Ka Wai Chuen and Verbena Heights, etc. 33.5 URA allocated vacant flats to eligible tenants in accordance with the established allocation standards of floor areas of HKHS and HKHA as well as the family size of the tenants. However, as the supply of public rental housing was limited, URA could only make allotment of suitable public housing to eligible domestic tenants being affected based on the resources available. In the past, URA allocated public housing units for two to three persons or three to four persons to tenants with three family members. However, in the light of a shortage in public rental housing with greater floor areas at present, URA could only allocate larger flats to families of larger sizes. 33.6 Regarding redevelopment planning, a sitting-out area would be provided near Eiver House for the use of the public. The works were expected to be completed between 2025 and 2026. 33.7 URA would expedite rehousing arrangements for tenants. If the tenants were not eligible for public rental housing, URA would consider rehousing them in the units of re-housing blocks provided by URA or offering them enhanced ex-gratia allowance which, for instance, had been revised from 3.5 times the rateable value of the property concerned to 9 times the rateable value of the first HK$10,000, 8 times the rateable value of the second HK$10,000, and so on and down to one time the rateable value of the ninth HK$10,000 or above. Moreover, the total amount of ex-gratia allowance had been increased from a minimum amount of HK$70,000 for an one-person household to HK$170,000 and from a minimum amount of HK$80,000 to HK$190,000 for a two-person or larger household to support the removal of residents. 33.8 After the Freezing Survey was completed, even if property owners 25 substantially increased rent for tenants, URA would, after acquiring the relevant property, only charge the tenants the amount of rent they paid when the Freezing Survey was being conducted. If domestic tenants and shop tenants had been registered on the date of the Freezing Survey, even though they were evicted by the owners later, they would be entitled to the ex-gratia allowance and rehousing in public rental housing subject to their eligibility in the future. 33.9 URA had also improved its way of levying water and electricity charges from subdivided units and would adopt the lowest reading recorded among the households as the basis of calculation in a bid to reduce the economic burden of the tenants. Besides, URA had designated security guards to enhance patrol of vacant flats, ground floor shops and public venues in redevelopment areas as well as posted on the entrance of every building the locations and contacting numbers of security offices to facilitate residents calling for assistance at any time. URA would also arrange cleaning workers to conduct regular cleaning to improve hygiene and the living environment. 34. Mr LEUNG Tak-ming of URA stated that, to reduce the impacts of construction works on the public in the future, piling and foundation works would be carried out using silent construction methods. URA would also request contractors to monitor the noise level and the air quality during the construction works. 35. Ms Maggie AU of LandsD said URA had submitted an application to the Development Bureau (DevB) for invoking LRO to acquire the property titles not yet resumed successfully. LandsD would convey KCDC’s views to the Secretary for Development, who would consider whether to relay the relevant proposals for land resumption to the Chief Executive in Council. If the Chief Executive issued orders to resume the land, LandsD would gazette the land resumption notices. As regards compensation, in accordance with LRO and the relevant policies, affected property owners would receive compensation while eligible occupants would be offered ex-gratia allowance. 36. Mr HO Hin-ming enquired if there was a discrepancy between the amount of compensation calculated in accordance with LRO and the price currently quoted by URA, property owners could reject the compensation and acquisition proposals of the Government or not. 26  37. Miss KWONG Po-yin pointed out that HD had stated that the tenants could contact them directly and reveal the type of public rental housing units they wished to be allocated. She asked if the allocation practice adopted for this exercise was HD authorising URA to assign housing units. Besides, the compensation offered by URA to the tenants of street shops would prompt the owners to force the tenants to move out and then arrange related persons to operate at the shop spaces so that they could obtain the whole of the compensation. In consideration of this, URA should plug the loopholes. Miss KWONG also questioned if individual tenants were asked to move out upon the expiry of the lease and URA failed to mediate the conflict, in what way URA could prevent the landlord from compelling the tenants to leave in an attempt to acquire more compensation. 38. Mr LAI Kwong-wai expressed his views as follows: (i) he urged Mr Ian WONG and Ir WAI Chi-sing of URA to meet the relevant organisations and residents affected by the redevelopment project in a bid to respond to their requests; and (ii) URA should hold briefings for the organisations and residents affected before land resumption. 39. Mr Roger KWAN made the following comments / enquiries: (i) according to LRO, the compensation was calculated on the basis of the prevailing market price. However, he would like to know whether URA could ensure that the owners would not have to bear the loss of the difference between the new market value and the previously assessed one in case the property market came to a down turn; and (ii) he appealed to URA to lend more support or pay extra compensation to the tenants of shop spaces having regard that the owners tended to employ unfair means to drive away long time tenants so as to get every bit of the compensation. He also asked URA to review the compensation arrangements for both the tenants and the owners in an effort to better utilise public funds to stop owners from gaining more compensation by way of evicting the tenants or letting out shops in the form of short term tenancy. 40. Mr Ian WONG of URA gave a consolidated reply, with the main points as follows: 40.1 According to the current practice, URA would try to make the acquisition offers close to the market prices, including using the price per square foot of a seven-year-old notional replacement flat in the same locality as the basis for calculating the offers. The owner-occupiers were eligible for 100% of 27 the Home Purchase Allowance (HPA) while the non-occupier-owners would be granted a certain percentage of HPA as compensation facilitating their purchase of replacement units. 40.2 In case the market value of the units being acquired dropped by the deadline for owners to accept acquisition offers, URA would not pay the difference in values. In conducting land resumption, the Government would work out the amount of compensation based on the prevailing market condition on the day of land resumption by the Government as stipulated by LRO. The property prices could be lower than the acquisition price originally proposed by URA due to the downtrend of the property market. And the owners should make appropriate decisions taking into account the changes in property prices. 40.3 URA maintained active communication with HA and HKHS and assigned public housing units to the affected households in accordance with the preset criteria for space allocation. 40.4 The owners of shop spaces could not force the tenants to move out without reasonable grounds before the expiry of the tenancy agreement. Should such cases happen, URA would approach the owners to ask for the reasons they required the tenants to leave and mediation would be provided. Under the current policy, if the shop tenants were eventually asked to pull out on expiry of the tenancy agreement, URA would hand out ex-gratia business allowance to the tenants concerned. Upon successful acquisition by URA or recovery of the property by the Government, the ex-gratia business allowance would be granted to the tenants. URA would earnestly consider Members’ opinions and strive to enhance the relevant policies. 40.5 URA would arrange briefings for residents after the resumption plan was gazetted and would hold discussion with the owners and the tenants at appropriate time. 41. The Chairman, in conclusion, said that Members wished to see a speedy implementation of the redevelopment project and URA would discuss with Members about the community planning at HIC meetings when the project was confirmed.  28 Request for Enhancing Protection of Personal Privacy (KCDC Paper No. 94/18) 42. Mr Terence SIU introduced Paper No. 94/18, expressing that the Government should effect stricter regulation on enterprises in the collection of personal data so as to protect privacy of the public. 43. Ir Dr CHENG Lee-ming said that the law of protecting personal data in Hong Kong lagged behind other countries and the penalties were too lenient. He suggested that the Government should make reference to foreign countries and ensure compliance by public utilities. 44. Mr Tony LAM of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) gave a reply with the following main points: 44.1 PCPD had launched an investigation into the data leakage incident of Cathay Pacific Airways and yet, subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, he could not disclose the details and progress of the investigation. 44.2 Under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, enterprises and organisations were not required to inform PCPD and the affected persons about the leakage of personal data. However, PCPD had all along been encouraging enterprises and organisations to make speedy report on such cases and relevant guidelines were issued. 44.3 Up to 9 am on 22 November, a total of 163 enquiries and 129 complaints were received by PCPD from members of the public, who mainly expressed concern about the data breach and enquired about ways to reduce the impact. They were also dissatisfied that Cathay Pacific did not disclose the leakage incident until after seven months. PCPD would handle all the enquiries and complaints in accordance with the established procedures and the performance pledge of the Office. As to claims for compensation, PCPD would explain to the people concerned matters related to application for legal assistance and stress to them that application and vetting procedures would only commence in the event that the breach was substantiated. 44.4 There were voices saying that the incident showed the need to revise and fine-29 tune the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance. PCPD was currently co-operating with the Government to review the relevant provisions of the Ordinance and penalties etc. as well as conceive ways to enhance data protection and the mechanism of notification. Request for Reviewing the Contingency Measures before and after Natural Disasters (KCDC Paper No. 95/18) 45. Mr. Admond YUE presented Paper No. 95/18 and urged the Government to review the contingency measures after natural disasters, including arrangements for the resumption of work and school after disasters and the policy on trees. 46. The Hon Starry LEE said that the Security Bureau (SB) was currently leading a team to go over the Government's contingency measures after natural disasters. She also commented that the existing manpower, equipment and planning were inadequate for carrying out contingency measures and follow-up work after typhoons of similar scale. Therefore, the relevant departments should conduct a review as soon as possible and inform Members about the result in due course. 47. Mr HO Hin-ming remarked that more than two months had elapsed since the typhoon but broken branches, cables and water pipes were not totally cleared. The relevant departments should conduct the clearance as soon as possible. 48. Ms Florence KO, Head of Tree Management Office of DevB gave a reply delivering the following main points: 48.1 DevB instructed the departments responsible for tree management to check the trees at places with high pedestrian and vehicular flow and take appropriate precautions including clearing dead branches and trees with structural defects or enclosing trees to be handled immediately before typhoon. It also appealed to private property owners, owners' corporations and management companies to handle the trees under their management with care so as to prevent mishaps. 48.2 Typhoon Mangkhut brought about the hoisting of typhoon signal no. 10, resulting in an extensive collapse of trees in Hong Kong. After the typhoon, over 60,800 tree falling cases were recorded and DevB had once 30 urged the Tree Management Office (TMO) to inspect trees in areas with high pedestrian and vehicular flow as well as implement appropriate relief measures such as stabilising trees, straightening leaning trees or supporting trees by cables and props, removing hanging branches and unstable trees as well as cordoning off damaged trees to minimise safety risks. 48.3 The tree management departments undertook tree risk assessments and necessary mitigation measures every year before the onset of typhoon and rainy seasons to reduce the risk of tree collapse. This year's tree risk assessment had begun and the departments concerned had successively reviewed the trees at places with high flow of people and traffic so as to conduct and implement risk mitigation measures. 48.4 Before replanting work commenced, the departments concerned had to clear the trees damaged, inspect in full the places for plantation and degree of devastation in the vicinity. The discussions among DevB and the relevant departments had begun and interdepartmental meetings were convened to map out plans and time tables for replanting. DevB would continue to nurture trees with care and ensure the sustainable growth of trees. 48.5 DevB would adopt the “Right Tree, Right Place” principle and plant suitable species of trees at various places. It would publish the Street Tree Selection Guide in December, listing out 80 kinds of trees which were suitable for planting in streets with the abilities to survive against wind, heat, drought and flooding as well as resist pests and diseases. 49. Ms LAI Mei-ling, Chief Leisure Manager (Kowloon) of LCSD gave a reply delivering the following main points: 49.1 LCSD inspected trees and executed risk mitigation measures such as pruning dead or broken branches and clearing trees before typhoon seasons every year in accordance with the guidelines issued by DevB. 49.2 Typhoons might result in a large number of fallen trees and LCSD would assign staff to remove fallen trees immediately afterwards. A priority order would be set in clearing the trees and those causing blockage to motorways and pavements would be handled first. 31 49.3 At present, most of the fallen trees affecting or blocking passages in parks were moved away. The Department would continue to arrange for the contractor to handle the fallen trees in flower beds and follow up with replanting later. According to the guidelines of TMO, the Department would take into account of the environment and the species of trees when carrying out replanting. 50. Ms Catalina SIT of Education Bureau (EDB) expressed the following main points in her reply: 50.1 Before the typhoon Mangkhut struck Hong Kong, EDB had issued a message to all the schools in Hong Kong on 13 September via the electronic system, reminding the schools to pay close attention to the information about weather and rainfall distribution in various districts released by the Hong Kong Observatory and the announcements made by EDB. The schools were alerted to take precautionary measures, for example, for those schools which had arranged activities on 14 or 15 September, contingency plans should be prepared as soon as possible. 50.2 In view that trees would pose great risks in adverse weather conditions, EDB forwarded a letter on tree safety at school premises to all schools in Hong Kong on 14 September, prompting schools to check the condition of the trees regularly and to hire professionals to undertake risk mitigation measures and tree care work to ensure safety. 50.3 Schools were subject to varying degrees of damage during typhoon and thus clearance and maintenance for school facilities were required in the aftermath. Considering that public transport facilities did not fully resume service instantly, EDB announced suspension of classes on 17 and 18 September to ensure the safety of students. It also maintained active communication with schools to learn about the damage of schools and provide those in need with advice and support. 51. Mr Francis KWOK, the Kowloon City District Officer, added that the team led by SB was reviewing the Government's arrangements for handling typhoons or serious natural disasters. The Home Affairs Department, as a member of the team, would reflect the views of Members and report to Members the latest development later. 32 Application for KCDC Funds ─ Community Involvement Projects Organised in the 2018-2019 Financial Year (KCDC Paper No. 96/18) 52. The Secretary introduced Paper No. 96/18 at the request of the Chairman. 53. After consulting the views of all Members, the Chairman announced the approval of an allocation of $324,500 for funding the X RUNNING YOUTH 2019, a talent show of youths organised by the Kowloon City District Youth Programme Committee in the 2018-19 financial year. Date of Next Meeting 54. The Chairman said that the next meeting of KCDC would be held on 24 January 2019 and the closing date for submission of papers would be 9 January 2019. There being no other business, the Chairman adjourned the meeting at 6:25 p.m.  The minutes of this meeting were confirmed on 24 January 2019.
